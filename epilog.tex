When beginning this work, two goals were set: to make an extremely extensible and easily modifiable run-time, while maintaining the speed.

The run-time indeed is flexible, allowing Objective-C features, such as class categories, associated objects, and others, to be implemented separately using class extensions, making it extensible.

Function pointers used by the run-time allow it to be ported to many different platforms with a great ease.

The benchmarks show that using the inline caching, impressive speeds may be achieved as well, reaching about half the speed of a direct C call. Without any inline caching, the speeds are not as impressive, yet still faster than Apple's run-time when it uses no inline caching.

Altogether, I believe the goals set at the beginning of the work have been achieved.
